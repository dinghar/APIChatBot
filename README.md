# APIChatBot (WIP)

This API (APIChatBot) will be used to power a chatbot. The bot will ingest an API spec for an external API and a plaintext request from a user. APIChatBot will use the OpenAI API to generate a request to the external API. APIChatBot will make a call to the external API and the response will be returned to the user. Responses from the external API will be logged to train the chatbot.
